# Bulk_RNA-seq

Analysis of Bulk RNA-seq data of 9 samples coming from 3 different tissues. For each of them three different samples were selected and analysed:

Liver (SRR1324412, SRR1100991, SRR1349479)
Kidney (SRR1486080, SRR1490658, SRR1325483)
Heart (SRR606939, SRR1468613, SRR815184)

The analysis is done using the available packages on Bioconductor and CRAN, in particular with EdgeR. This package implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions which are used for the computation of differential expression of genes across the samples.
